# Fundamentals Inter-Review

**Welcome to your first Inter-Review!** Think of this as a review of material we have covered in an interview-style format. The best way to learn a language is to speak it, practice it, and you are learning a new language: data science. You will hear us model speaking data science, using the proper technical terminology, every day, and you will be practicing your new language when speaking to us as well your cohort colleagues. One way to attack "Imposter Syndrome" is to get comfortable hearing yourself speak data science.

## Review Questions

Each person in your group will take a turn asking and answering the following questions. Just like in an interview, a one-word answer is not the goal here.

1. What is data science, in your own words? Why is data science for you, and what brings you to the field?

2. What are some differences between Supervised and Unsupervised machine Learning?

3. How do you rest your brain from looking at a computer screen?

4. What do you foresee as the biggest challenge for you in this program? Where do you feel you might be the most comfortable, or what are you most excited about learning in the program?

5. How do you start a project?

6. What are some of the python libraries we will use to analyze and visualize our data in Codeup and beyond?
